          <p class="paper-abstract">
            Several European countries have reformed their citizenship policies over the past decades. There is much to
            learn from their experience of how citizenship works; for whom it works; and what rules and policies matter
            for integration. The article surveys recent quasi-experimental evidence and field experiments from the
            social sciences on the link between eligibility rules, take-up and integration outcomes. Across countries
            and reforms, the evidence shows that faster access to citizenship increases take-up and improves the
            economic, educational, political and social integration of immigrants. Other eligibility rules like civic
            knowledge tests or application fees also impact who naturalizes and therefore benefits from citizenship.
            Birthright citizenship, which is much less common in Europe, turns out to be a powerful tool for getting
            second-generation immigrants off to a good start. Together, citizenship acts as a powerful catalyst
            benefiting immigrants as well as host countries.

            We analyze whether faster access to citizenship fosters the economic integration of immigrants. Our
            empirical setting is Germany, which went from a strict concept of citizenship based on 'jus sanguinis' to a
            more open citizenship policy. We make use of discontinuities in residency requirements faced by
            first-generation immigrants to estimate LATEs based on Local Randomization and Fuzzy RDD approaches. We find
            that a more liberal citizenship policy acts as a catalyst for integration, especially for immigrant women.
            Women's labor force participation increases by 8.9 percentage points and their earnings by 21.3%. We do not
            find any significant effects on immigrant men.

          </p>
          <p class="paper-abstract">
            Using scraped data from the Airbnb platform in New York City and face classification algorithms, we first
            show that Black minority hosts have 6 percentage points lower occupancy rates than their white counterparts.
            For Asians and Hispanics, we find no significant difference. Second, relying on difference-in-differences
            design and event-study plots, we examine the effect of an Airbnb anti-discrimination design change, which
            reduces the prominence of profile pictures. This design intervention does not effectively close the
            ethnicity gap in occupancy rates. On the contrary, in the short run, it intensifies the White-Black
            disparity by 4 percentage points. We delve into the underlying mechanism showing that bias and uncertainty
            in detecting facial cues, like smiling, increase significantly after the design change. Moreover, negatively
            affected by the anti-discrimination policy, only Black hosts reacted by offering more basic amenities for
            their listings.

          <h3 class="paper-title">Mapping Artificial Intelligence: Evidence from Firm-Level Web Data in Europe</h3>
          <p class="paper-meta">

          <p class="paper-abstract">
            We develop a novel firm-level indicator of Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption in Europe by applying a
            Large Language Model to more than four million firm websites from Belgium, France, Germany, and Luxembourg
            (2016–2024). The method detects not only whether firms adopt AI, but also their role in the AI ecosystem and
            the type of AI technology they employ. The share of AI-active firms grew from 1% in 2016 to 12% in 2024,
            with acceleration after 2022. We document a structural transformation: the ecosystem is shifting from
            specialized AI core technology providers toward broader AI adopters, signaling widespread diffusion. While
            adoption is concentrated among larger, younger, knowledge-intensive firms in urban innovation clusters,
            workforce skills emerge as a key factor for AI adoption. Our results suggest that foundational Data skills
            form the necessary base for adoption, while specialized AI skills act as strong complements. Our
            website-based measure diverges meaningfully from industry exposure-based indices, revealing that actual
            adoption often differs from potential exposure.
